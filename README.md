# RestEngine
Framework for easy access to rest apis

This Framwork will wrap all the incombences of rest api access with a Functional Reactive Programming interface (RxSwift). It will take care of making network requests, handling the cache, showing the progress bars, and even handle disconnection and reconnection to the internet.

*Usage examples coming, sorry*
